### 2. Description

Get Pet Vet was born out of an idea to create an application to help the health of pets while decrease the risk of contracting and spreading Covid-19. Get Pet Vet allows the user to schedule an appointment with a vet for the minor needs that might be needed when caring for a pet. If your pet has a small rash, or other not serious ailment you can schedule an appointment with a veterinarian and get your pet checked out to learn the remedies needed to keep your pets safe.

### 6. Challenges and Learning

[Nikolas Lenning](https://github.com/nikolaslenning) - The biggest challenge for me was the back and for of socket.io in establishing rooms as well as connecting the users to their respective rooms. 

[Seth Martineau](https://github.com/slothings) - The biggest challenge for me was working on sockets.io and getting to understand it and how it interacts with each other in a full stack app and integrating the front end with the back end. This project helped me fully understand the workings of a full stack app with all its integration, process, and problems.

[Sydney Goodwill](https://github.com/SydneyGoodwill) - I'm baby deep v messenger bag aliquip, laboris try-hard seitan gochujang in vape semiotics quinoa thundercats nostrud deserunt dolore.

[Zach LaFleur](https://github.com/MrCartree) - The biggest challenge for me during this project was socket.io. I had worked with it previously on other apps but bring it in here for the use of video and audio proved to be quite the challenge. It was interesting to make the hang up button because you cannot cancel both audio and video at the same time and need to target them individually in order to shut them off. There was so much to learn from this project, from the way things interact with each other in full stack, as well as little stylings that made the whole thing unbearable.
