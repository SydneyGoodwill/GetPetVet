### 2. Description

Get Pet Vet was born out of an idea to create an application to help the health of pets while decrease the risk of contracting and spreading Covid-19. Get Pet Vet allows the user to schedule an appointment with a vet for the minor needs that might be needed when caring for a pet. If your pet has a small rash, or other not serious ailment you can schedule an appointment with a veterinarian and get your pet checked out to learn the remedies needed to keep your pets safe.

### 6. Challenges and Learning

[Nikolas Lenning](https://github.com/nikolaslenning) - The biggest challenge for me was the back and for of socket.io in establishing rooms as well as connecting the users to their respective rooms. 

[Seth Martineau](https://github.com/slothings) - The biggest challenge for me was working on sockets.io and getting to understand it and how it interacts with each other in a full stack app and integrating the front end with the back end. This project helped me fully understand the workings of a full stack app with all its integration, process, and problems.
