### 2. Description

Get Pet Vet was born out of an idea to create an application to help the health of pets while decrease the risk of contracting and spreading Covid-19. Get Pet Vet allows the user to schedule an appointment with a vet for the minor needs that might be needed when caring for a pet. If your pet has a small rash, or other not serious ailment you can schedule an appointment with a veterinarian and get your pet checked out to learn the remedies needed to keep your pets safe.
